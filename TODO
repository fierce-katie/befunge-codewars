+ Addition: Pop a and b, then push a+b.

- Subtraction: Pop a and b, then push b-a.

* Multiplication: Pop a and b, then push a*b.

/ Integer division: Pop a and b, then push b/a, rounded down. If a is zero, 
  push zero.

% Modulo: Pop a and b, then push the b%a. If a is zero, push zero.

` Greater than: Pop a and b, then push 1 if b>a, otherwise push zero.

? Start moving in a random cardinal direction.

\ Swap two values on top of the stack. If there is only one value, pretend there
  is an extra 0 on bottom of the stack.
